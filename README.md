# Introduction

This project is designed for me better learning cookbooks with [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)-generated mindmaps.

First, I download the ebook I want to study and summarize it into a mindamap using NotebookLM. There is no other quick and accurate way to get an overview of a book, but that does not mean I can easily understand all of its content.

Next, I retext the mindmap while learning each chapter at the same time.
There is a mindmap visulizer called [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/), which you can install as a VS Code extension, and its syntax is based on Markdown.

The whole process involves retexting the NotebookLM mindmap. If there's something I want to exlore more in more details. I can look it up in the correspoding chapter and add notes.

For this project, the focus is on leaning quantitatve coding skills. Therefore, I use Jupter Notebook alongside each book's mindmap and chapter.

## Book List

The mindmaps are in the `figures/book_mindmap`. Currently, mindmaps for these books are generated.
