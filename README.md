# Introduction

This project is designed for me better learning cookbooks with [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)-generated mindmaps.

First, I download the ebook I want to study and use NotebookLM to summarize it into mindamap. However, this doesn't mean I can immediately understand all of its content.

Next, I revise and rephrase the mindmap while learning each chapter.
For visualization, I use [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/)--a mindmap visualizer as a VS Code extension that uses Markdown syntax.

The overall process involves reworking the NotebookLM-generated mindmap. If there's something I want to exlore more in more details. I refer back to the correspoding chapter and write more details notes or codes file under each directory.

For this project, the primary focus is on developing **quantitative coding skills**. Therefore, I use Jupter Notebook alongside each book's mindmap and chapter as notes and explore ideas.

## Book List

All mindmaps are stored in the `figures/book_mindmap`. Currently, mindmaps for these books are generated.
